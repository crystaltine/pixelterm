# Manual tests

Unittests/pytest not available for most cases since functionality is strictly limited to the terminal (some small things like anchor calculations/terminal size can be tested, but that's it).

To run the non-automated tests you need to run each of the files from the base directory (../pixelterm) and select which function to use.

`python tests/<manual_test_...>.py`
